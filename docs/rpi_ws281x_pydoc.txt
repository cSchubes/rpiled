CLASSES
    __builtin__.object
        Adafruit_NeoPixel
    
    class Adafruit_NeoPixel(__builtin__.object)
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __del__(self)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, num, pin, freq_hz=800000, dma=5, invert=False)
     |      Class to represent a NeoPixel/WS281x LED display.  Num should be the
     |      number of pixels in the display, and pin should be the GPIO pin connected
     |      to the display signal line (must be a PWM pin like 18!).  Optional
     |      parameters are freq, the frequency of the display signal in hertz (default
     |      800khz), dma, the DMA channel to use (default 5), and invert, a boolean
     |      specifying if the signal line should be inverted (default False).
     |  
     |  begin(self)
     |      Initialize library, must be called once before other functions are
     |      called.
     |  
     |  getPixelColor(self, n)
     |      Get the 24-bit RGB color value for the LED at position n.
     |  
     |  getPixels(self)
     |      Return an object which allows access to the LED display data as if 
     |      it were a sequence of 24-bit RGB values.
     |  
     |  numPixels(self)
     |      Return the number of pixels in the display.
     |  
     |  setBrightness(self, brightness)
     |      Scale each LED in the buffer by the provided brightness.  A brightness
     |      of 0 is the darkest and 255 is the brightest.  Note that scaling can have
     |      quantization issues (i.e. blowing out to white or black) if used repeatedly!
     |  
     |  setPixelColor(self, n, color)
     |      Set LED at position n to the provided 24-bit color value (in RGB order).
     |  
     |  setPixelColorRGB(self, n, red, green, blue)
     |      Set LED at position n to the provided red, green, and blue color.
     |      Each color component should be a value from 0 to 255 (where 0 is the
     |      lowest intensity and 255 is the highest intensity).
     |  
     |  show(self)
     |      Update the display with the data from the LED buffer.
     |  

FUNCTIONS
    Color(red, green, blue)
        Convert the provided red, green, blue color to a 24-bit color value.
        Each color component should be a value 0-255 where 0 is the lowest intensity
        and 255 is the highest intensity.
